## Software Architecture 🏗️

The Travel Tracker App will be built using a 3-tier architecture, consisting of the presentation layer, application layer, and data layer. The presentation layer will handle user interactions with the app and display all the data in the post and user information on the post to the user. The application layer will handle data processing and fetching. The data layer will be responsible for data storage and retrieval. For example, when a user wants to search for something, the presentation layer would request a query with filters to get the corresponding posts. The application will be built using Flask, a Python-based web framework for the application layer. The front end will be developed using React, a popular Javascript framework. The backend will be built using MySQL or SQLite.
